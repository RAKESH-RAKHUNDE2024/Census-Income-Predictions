- ## MOTIVATION:-
- Building Such Predictive Models Can Help Us Better Understand The Population Of A Country As Well As The Various Factors Affecting The Growth In The Economy.
- Governments Can Understand Such Factors And Improve Upon Them Leading To The Growth Of The Country.

## CONCLUSION:-
- In This Project We Build Various Models Like Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier And Xgboost Calssifier.
- A Hyperparameter Tuned Random Forest Classifier Gives The Highest Accuracy Score Of 91.01 And F1 Score Of 91.48

## FUTURE WORK:-
- We Have A Large Enough DATASET, So We Can Use Neural Networks Such As An Artificial Neural Network To Build A Model Which Can Result In Better Performance.
